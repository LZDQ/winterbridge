# Coming Soon

#### Note

When I transferred this mod from Linux to Windows, the http from java couldn't work. I tried for hours and created a new java project to test, but the new one succeeded and the mod didn't. After searching for information online for hours, I didn't find the answer and saw something IP address related problems. So I changed the 'localhost' to '127.0.0.1' and it worked??

# TO-DO

* Diagonal bridge
* claroviyance (all players' positions, effects such as invis, bed cover materials, etc.)
